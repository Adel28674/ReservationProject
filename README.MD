1. Introduction
This document outlines a streamlined plan for building a simple reservation system using Spring Boot, Angular, and PostgreSQL. The goals are divided into three categories based on necessity and difficulty: Mandatory, Comfort, and Luxury. The focus is on balancing learning objectives with achievable milestones.

2. Objectives
2.1 Mandatory Objectives
These are the foundational goals that are essential to make the system functional. They provide a minimal viable product (MVP) while covering basic backend, frontend, and database interactions.

Core Entities and Database Setup:

Define key entities and relationships:
User: Fields include ID, name, and email.
Resource: Fields include ID, name, description, and availability status.
Reservation: Fields include ID, user ID, resource ID, reservation date, start time, and end time.
Implement relationships:
A user can make multiple reservations.
A resource can have multiple reservations but cannot overlap in time.
Create corresponding tables in PostgreSQL with appropriate constraints.
Backend API (Spring Boot):

Implement REST endpoints for:
Users:
Create a user.
Retrieve the list of users.
Resources:
Create a resource.
Retrieve the list of available resources.
Reservations:
Create a reservation (ensure no overlapping for the resource).
Retrieve reservations for a specific user or resource.
Frontend (Angular):

Build a simple user interface:
Display a list of available resources.
Provide a form to make a reservation.
Validation:

Implement backend validation to:
Ensure that a resource cannot be reserved if already booked for the requested time.
Prevent invalid data (e.g., reservations in the past or missing fields).
2.2 Comfort Objectives
These goals enhance the system with additional functionality and usability features. They focus on improving user experience and adding basic security.

User Authentication and Authorization:

Implement JWT-based authentication:
Allow users to sign up and log in.
Secure reservation endpoints so that only authenticated users can create or view reservations.
Add basic roles:
Admin: Can manage resources (CRUD).
User: Can view and book resources.
Improved Reservation Management:

Add rules to limit reservation length (e.g., maximum 2 hours per reservation).
Prevent duplicate reservations by the same user for the same time slot.
Frontend Enhancements:

Create a user dashboard to:
View the user's existing reservations.
Cancel a reservation.
Add feedback messages for actions (e.g., "Reservation created successfully").
Error Handling:

Provide clear and meaningful error messages for common issues:
Invalid reservation times.
Trying to book an already reserved resource.
2.3 Luxury Objectives
These are optional and advanced goals that can be tackled after completing the core system. They aim to introduce more interactivity and polish to the application.

Resource Availability Display:

Visualize resource availability using:
A calendar-style view for easier navigation.
Highlight available time slots.
Notifications:

Send confirmation emails for reservations (using a service like Spring Mail).
Set up reminders before the reservation start time.
Admin Dashboard:

Provide an admin interface with:
Statistics on resource utilization.
Tools to manage users, resources, and reservations.
Frontend Styling and Responsiveness:

Improve the UI with a responsive design using a library like Angular Material or Bootstrap.
Add animations or tooltips for better user experience.
3. Development Plan
Phase 1: Build the MVP (Mandatory Objectives)
Duration: 1-2 weeks

Implement the core database schema and REST APIs.
Create a basic Angular interface to interact with the backend.
Ensure reservation conflicts are handled.
Phase 2: Add Usability Features (Comfort Objectives)
Duration: 1-2 weeks

Secure the application with authentication.
Create a user dashboard and enhance error handling.
Phase 3: Polish with Advanced Features (Luxury Objectives)
Duration: 2+ weeks

Add a calendar view and admin features.
Implement notifications and improve UI design.
4. Conclusion
By focusing on Mandatory Objectives first, youâ€™ll have a working system that provides real functionality. Once comfortable, you can gradually expand to include Comfort and Luxury features. This incremental approach ensures steady progress without feeling overwhelming.
